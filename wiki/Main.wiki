Currently an automated process to create needed files to replicate remote controls is only available for Windows platform; but it is possibile to create such files even by hand, using any O.S. supporting [http://sox.sourceforge.net/ SOX program]. SOX is available as:
*Redhat RPM package: i386 binary (Also available for other targets and as Source Code) 
*Debian package: Debian's SoX page 
*Win32 Binary (Win95/98/NT/XP/Vista): sox-14.0.1.zip 
*Win32 Cygwin Binary (With Audio support): sox-14.0.1-cygwin.zip 
*NetBSD: Various Binaries 
*OS/2 binary: sox-12.17.1.zip 
*BeOS Binary: sox-12.18.2-beos-x86-ogg.zip (with MP3 and Ogg), sox-12.18.2-beos-x86.zip *and sox-12.18.2-beos-ppc.zip (from PlanetMir) 
*Atari ST binary: sox12.17.2-m68k-atari.tgz (from PlanetMir) 
*DGJPP DOS Binary
